That mean that all javascript ES5, 6 ... is valid typescript, but typescript add many useful features. The more important is the hard typings but not only.\nLike ES6 and all new javascript brand, it need to be compiled to current javascript so that actual browsers can interpret it.\nResources\n\nType script official documentation https://www.typescriptlang.org/\nAn open source book on typescript https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript\n\nQuestions about d.ts file\n\nwhat is a d.ts files : A d.ts file is a definition file created to make available typings for libraries that do not use typescript.\nhow typescript know where the types definition the d.ts file is ? Types definitions are informed in the package.json of the library. In our sweetalert2 example \"types\": \"sweetalert2.d.ts\", the following key is enough to tell typescript that the type definition file is at the root of the library in a file named sweetalert2.d.ts.\n\nExample of a d.ts file\nhttps://github.com/limonte/sweetalert2/blob/master/sweetalert2.d.ts\nDefinition of the main function of sweealert 2 ( a library to display nice alert confirm modal\nfunction swal(title: string, message?: string, type?: SweetAlertType): Promise;\n\nThe function parameters are defined only. Not the content of the function as it is not the purpose of the typescript definition file (d.ts). This file purpose is to add the information about the types used and expected in the js files of existing libraries not written directly in typescript.\nLet's start to identify the syntax of function parameters :\n\ntitle is the first argument and should be a string\nmessage is the second argument and should be a string, it is an optional parameter it don't produce an error if not provided.\ntype is optional and is not using a standard type but a custom type SweetAlertType that is defined elsewhere\n: Promise refer to what the function should return. It should return a Promise with a collection / array of element of any types\n\nThen we follow with the definition of an interface. Interface is the definition of an empty object that serve as a model to constrain object with real data in it. It serve as a guide for developer that in the code use an implementation of this same object. It serve to define what we called custom types, types are not the standard string, boolean....\n export interface SweetAlertOptions {\n        /**\n         * The title of the modal, as HTML.\n         * It can either be added to the object under the key \"title\" or passed as the first parameter of the function.\n         * Default: null\n         */\n        title?: string;\n\n        /**\n         * The title of the modal, as text. Useful to avoid HTML injection.\n         * Default: null\n         */\n        titleText?: string;\n\n        // More fields definition\n   }\n\nAn other syntax is alternative types width?: number|string;Here we allow either number either string for the optional property 'width' of the SweetAlertOptions object.\nWe identify also this syntax preConfirm?: (inputValue: any) => Promise; it defined a function with the new ES6 syntax called fat arrow syntax => So this function assigned to optional preconfirm property need an argument inputValue of any type that return a promise with a collection of element of any type.\nAll this types declaration is wrapped in a declare module \"sweetalert2\" {that allow to map the declaration with module name sweetalert2that is defined in the main sweetalert2 js file\nContribute to create d.ts files\n\nThe following in depth tutorial explain how to create a definition files for an existing library. Seems boring?

Quel métier exerces-tu en freelance ?\nJe m'appelle Sébastien Lucas. Je suis développeur freelance autodidacte spécialisé en Angular coté front et node coté back. J'ai également une expertise en conception d'interface (UI-UX) et en integration web.\nDe formation initiale, je suis architecte. J'ai ainsi travaillé 7 ans en agence d'architecture, avant de me reconvertir dans le développement Web, l'entreprenariat et la photographie d'architecture.\nMes missions freelances sont essentiellement des missions de développeur front end spécialisé Angular.\nMais je ponctue cela de petits reportages photos pour quelques clients dans le domaine de l'architecture, une mission d'expert open innovation pour un grand groupe du BTP en tant qu'architecte. J'ai même conçue une maison en Bretagne dont la conception s'est étalée sur 3 ans!\nPour quels types de missions les clients te contactent-ils généralement ? Avec quels types de clients travailles-tu ?\nJe travaille principalement pour des clients, qui recherchent des développeurs front-end experimentés avec une expertise sur Angular. Dans certains cas, j'ai répondu à des misions full-stack, où j'avais la main sur le backend et le frontend. Enfin j'ai réalisé des projets avec une \"mission complète\", où mon rôle comprenait la conception des interfaces (UX-UI), le développement frontend et backend.\nMes clients sont principalement des startups, des agences Web ou des medias\nConcrètement, quels types de livrables peux-tu fournir ?\nLes missions étant relativement courtes (3-4 mois), il est rare que je termine entièrement un site ou une application. Généralement il y a un besoin au début de l'application, de manière à poser des bases propres. Ou bien pour renforcer les équipes à une période de surcharge ou de croissance de l'entreprise. Les deux cas de missions sont intéressants. Commencer de zéro permet de décider d'une architecture, de bonnes pratiques... Alors que collaborer sur un développement existant, permet d'apprendre des pratiques et méthodes, qu'on ne connait peut être pas et les intégrer à notre boîte à outil.\nComment en es-tu arrivé à travailler avec le framework Angular ?\nJe développe depuis plusieurs années une startup BRICKS, autour de deux projets principaux : Openbricks (www.openbricks.io), une plateforme de partage de projets d'architecture en open source et Bricks app (bricksapp.io), une application collaborative de gestion de projet en mode Agile destinée aux architectes. Mes choix de technologies : Node et angular ont été principalement fait en fonction des besoins de ces projets.\nJ'ai décidé d'adopter Angular en 2014 suite à une étude des frameworks MVC javascript disponible à l'époque (Ember vs Angular vs Backbone) et la dernière version angular 2 depuis fin 2016 en la comparant avec React principalement. Je suis resté fidèle à Angular, qui a un eco-sytème bien structuré et qui avance vite est ouvert aux évolutions et bonnes pratiques du web qu'il sait intégrer.\nAs-tu suivi une formation particulière ou es-tu autodidacte ?\nJe n'ai jamais suivi de formation de développeur proprement dite. Mais j'ai appris en lisant des centaines de tutoriels sur tous les sujets, que j'avais besoin d'apprendre et en pratiquant avant tout, pas à pas. Depuis mes débuts en 2008, l'offre de formation en ligne a explosée ! Maintenant il est beaucoup plus facile d'apprendre vite et bien grace aux sites de formation en ligne, aux tutoriels d'excellente qualité que l'on trouve sur le web, et à Stackoverflow qui a permis d'avoir une réponse unique pour une question bien précise.\nQu'est-ce qui te plait le plus dans ton métier ?\nCe qui me plait le plus est l'évolution continuelle des technologies. Il y toujours une nouvelle brique à apprendre et de nouvelles possibilités s'ouvrent sans-cesse pour mes propres sites et ceux de mes clients. Le deuxième aspect très positif est qu'il n'y a pas de crise de l'emploi dans ce domaine. C'est même plutôt le contraire !\nPourquoi as-tu fait le choix de devenir freelance ?\nEn fait la distinction freelance / salarié n'est pas si claire pour moi. Il y a beaucoup de freelances, qui ont des missions longues renouvellables et renouvelées de plusieurs années. Et inversement des salariés, qui peuvent enchainer les CDD.\nLe statut de freelance a des avantages, mais aussi beaucoup d'inconvénients : rémunération plus incertaine, pas les mêmes droits que les salariés, pas de vacances payées, pas de chômage, mauvaise presse vis à vis des tiers (logements, banque... ).\nDonc le principal avantage du statut de freelance, est de pouvoir simplement travailler pour différents clients et changer sans que cela soit compliqué.\nAprès des plateformes comme Hopwork, permettent de resoudre certains problèmes du statut de freelance, comme réduire les délais de payement ou réduire le temps nécessaire à la prospection entre chaque mission.\nQue faisais-tu avant de sauter le pas et de devenir freelance ? Quel a été ton déclic ?\nJ'ai travaillé en salarié en agence d'architecture ou pour du développement web en alternance avec des périodes de freelances. En fait, je crois beaucoup aux multi-statuts : ça permet de combiner les avantages de chaque statut et de pouvoir être plus résilient.\nLa principale motivation pour développer mon activité en freelance a été de développer mon projet de startup en parallèle, ce qui est plus souple que en salariat. Cela permet également d'avoir une plus grande variété de missions et de pouvoir choisir plus facilement son évolution.\nComment se sont passés tes débuts ? Est-ce que ton lancement a été compliqué ?\nOui mon lancement n'a pas été facile. En fait mes premières activités freelance en 2010, ont été la photographie d'architecture et la conception de sites web au forfait. Néanmoins la rentabilité n'était pas au rendez-vous, car tout le temps d'apprentissage indispensable surtout pour un autodidacte n'est pas financé par personne ! Donc il était deduit des maigres devis, que j'ai pu négocier au début.\nPar la suite, j'ai commencé à proposer mes services en tant que développeur non plus pour de petits sites aux forfaits, mais dans des agences où j'étais payé au temps passé. J'ai compris que dans le web, un site pouvait soit coûter 2000 euros pour un petit client ou 20 000 ou 50 000 si le client a plus de moyens. Et que faire un site ou une application, ça prend du temps !\nEn photographie, le principal problème est d'avoir assez de clients réguliers. Alors qu'en développement, il s'agit plus de comprendre comment trouver de bonnes boîtes avec un contexte intéressant, tout en évitant le système archaïque et chronophage des SSII.\nQuel conseil aurais-tu aimé recevoir quand tu as débuté ?\nNe pas laisser son numéro de téléphone surtout sur un site accessible par des SSII. Je ne décroche plus mon portable à cause d'eux ! Trouver de bonnes missions et refuser systèmatiquement les missions \"pompiers\" trop courtes ou celles où vous avez une impression négative sur l'équipe, le contexte.... Il y a beaucoup de missions en développement, il faut savoir choisir pour travailler dans un contexte positif et formateur. Enfin ne pas attendre le dernier moment pour chercher, car on sera moins apte à pouvoir attendre un peu pour choisir la meilleure mission.\nComment fais-tu face à toute la partie administrative ? As-tu des conseils pour d’autres freelances ?\nCet aspect est relativement simple pour le statut auto-entrepreneur. Pour les statuts entreprise, c'est plus compliqué. Il faut choisir les bons logiciels / offres de service qui permettent de déléguer à peu de frais. Repérer les startups francaises, qui proposent un service qui simplifie la vie... Pour ma part Dougs en compta et Payfit pour la gestion des payes.\nUne startup sera mieux à même de répondre à vos besoins et à moindre coût. Il n'y que la banque, où je n'ai pas encore trouvé de startups, qui fasse le job. Je dois donc encore subir encore le service cher et de mauvaise qualité des banques PRO classiques.\nAs-tu l'habitude de travailler avec d'autres freelances ?\nParfois on est plusieurs freelances sur une même mission. C'est agréable de pouvoir échanger entre freelances et non plus seulement avec des salariés de l'entreprise. On peut échanger des bons plans et des conseils sur notre activité.\nEt à côté du boulot, quelles sont tes activités ?\nJe fais du sport (piscine et course à pied) et plus récemment de la méditation. C'est important de pouvoir prendre du recul et ces activités sont parfaites pour cela.\nJe m'occupe de mes enfants et profite de la vie de famille.\nMais avant tout à coté du boulot de freelance, je travaille pour faire avancer ma startup ! Le temps est très rare, donc j'essaie d'être le plus efficace et productif possible.\n"},"2016-12-15-angular2-form-cheatsheet.html":{"url":"2016-12-15-angular2-form-cheatsheet.html","title":"2016-12-15-angular2-form-cheatsheet","keywords":"","body":"2016-12-15-angular2-form-cheatsheet\nAngular 2 form add many improvements on angular 1 version. There is good in depth tutorials explaining how to use it.\nLet's list the most important elements to record for those who used angular forms in version 1.\n2 ways to build forms : template driven and model driven\nTemplate driven is the traditional way with html and angular directives.\n\nAdvantages:\nFeel more natural and readable\nMore customizable for use case not foreseen by the framework\n\n\nDisadvantages:\nMany boilerplates code : code that is always the same in all forms and not specific to this specific form. Boilerplates code is error prone because you can always mistype... And when there is a change in a big site, hundreds of templates need to be changed.\nNot testable with units tests (Only by E2E tests)\n\n\n\nModel driven is with a form javascript API that angular 2 introduces in core. Where as in the version 1 only libraries were developing this concept.\n\nAdvantages:\nVery compact declarative style  form definition\nMinimal boilerplates\nEasy updates and config sharing among many forms\nTestable with units tests\n\n\nDisadvantages:\nYou need to learn the API\nMay feel less understandable for people that do not know the API\n\n\n\nTemplate driven forms\n\nWe need to import the form module to enable ngModel and form stuff\n\nimport {FormsModule} from \"@angular/forms\";\n@NgModule({\n    declarations: [App],\n    imports: [BrowserModule, FormsModule],\n    bootstrap: [App]\n})\n\nThe Ng-model accept two-way or one-way binding\nWith angular 1 forms, we had the case that the changes in the form get reflected instantly in the rest of the page. As 2 way binding was the default. This could not be always intended. In angular 2, you have the choice :\n\n[(ngModel)]=\"proj.field\" : to have the form state reflected back in real time (two way binding)\n[ngModel]=\"proj.field\" : to have the form data just initialized and actualized programmatically when the form is submitted and when the api call is successful. (one way binding)\nngModel: If you do not want initialization but form validation a simple  ngModel without any field or object\n\nSyntax the name the form\nTo identify the form and be able to access it's data (not the ng-model) but all data about form validation, touched, non touched states... you use this syntax :\n#NameOfYouForm=\"ngForm\"\nYes it is strange! But why not?\n\n\nYou probably need to access it to prevent the form to be submitted. myForm.valid is testing a global form bolean that is true if all form fields are valid (required fields filled, no validation errors...)\nSubmit\n\nForm controls\nEach field identified by a name is\n\n\nAnd could be found in myForm.forms.controls.\n"},"2019-02-01-new-redux.html":{"url":"2019-02-01-new-redux.html","title":"2019-02-01-new-redux","keywords":"","body":"2019-02-01-new-redux\nWhat's new and hot! and will soon revolutionize or not the way we work\nNew redux\n\nhttps://hackernoon.com/redesigning-redux-b2baee8b8a38 https://github.com/rematch/rematch\nhttps://github.com/ngxs https://ngxs.gitbook.io/ngxs/\n\nGraphql\n...\n"},"2016-12-15-angular2-dependencies.html":{"url":"2016-12-15-angular2-dependencies.html","title":"2016-12-15-angular2-dependencies","keywords":"","body":"2016-12-15-angular2-dependencies\nAngular 2 is built on external dependencies.

Indispensable pour mettre en production.\n\nDocker Swarm: simple à utiliser et inclu dans Docker. Bien pour commencer\nKubernetes: Plus complexe mais leader du marché de l'orchestration. Utilisé par Github, Wikimedia...\nMesos: Utilisé par Netflix, Twitter...\n\nLes services cloud sont en compétition pour offrir une implémentation de Kubernetes la plus aisée possible.\nService cloud kubernetes :\n\nGKE de google\nAmazon ECS (la version amazon) et EKS (Kubernetes) / Azure ACS \nCloud alibaba \nCloud Redhat\n\nLes questions\n\nQuel est le meilleur site pour commencer ?\n\nLe site de docker est bien pour commencer, Docker Academy... jusqu'à Swarm. Pour Kubernetes, il faut passer à autre chose.\n\nJe ne suis pas devops mais dev, j'utilise docker compose en prod. Est ce que Swarm est utilisable en prod ?\n\nPour une application très simple avec une API en node js et le front sur Angular. Le Docker swarm permet de faire un cluster avec le front et le back. Et donc Swarn suffit pour des architectures simples. Kubernetes est recommmandé pour aller plus loin.\n\nEst ce que Docker Swarm a un réel overhead sur les perfs par rapport à une install native\n\nUn container par machine virtuelle sans orchestration c'est du gaspillage. Avec de l'orchestration, on peut mettre beaucoups de conteneurs sur la même machine. Ils peuvent communiquer à travers un reseau interne, ou si si plusieurs machines, récréer un lien virtuel entre tout ces conteneurs sur plusieurs machines.\n\nAs-tu testé Traefik ?\n\nTraefik permet de gérer des micro-services. Les micro-services sont moins en vogue et rejoignent les conteneurs, car ils partagent les mêmes concepts, la découverte...\n\n\nLe futur du conteneur ?: \n\nStateless et Serverless !\n\nLa base de donnée dans un conteneur ?\n\nPas le plus simple, et pas dans la logique stateless. Plus simple d'avoir une base de donnée dans le cloud, le faire avec des conteneurs moins simple. Une intervention d'un développeur: la base de donnée peut être mis dans un container, mais la data elle-même est mis sur le host du container. L'avantage de mettre la base de donnée dans un containeur permet de mettre à jour la version de base de donnée, très simplement....\n"},"2017-11-20-sass-css-libraries.html":{"url":"2017-11-20-sass-css-libraries.html","title":"2017-11-20-SASS-CSS-libraries","keywords":"","body":"2017-11-20-SASS-CSS-libraries\nFrameworks\n\nTwitter

is an interesting tool for web developer as it is as the crossroad of database ui like phpmyadmin, robotmongo, a spreadsheet like google spreadsheet and an api.\nYou can use airtable as an api in a nobackend strategy. Even if you end up using other data storage. It is a good way to start prototyping with true data. Its simplicity allow all team members even non technical to participate.\nYou can create your free account.\nWhere to find documentation about Airtable API ?\nThe main documentation is in your Airtable App and contextual to your data.\n\nClick on the contextual menu    \n\n\n\nThen a documentation screen show up relevant to your database settings    \n\n![airtable3.png]\n\nA blog post explaining some changes (feb 2016) to the api client\na codepen allowing to quickly url encode parameters (to play along with post man rest api client)\n\nAirtable API usage examples\nLet's look at some nice uses of airtable API.\nIn all examples {tableId} is to be replaced by your table Id. And {DatabaseId} by your database Id\n\nLimit number of items per page   \nTo do pagination   \n\n\nhttps://api.airtable.com/v0/{DatabaseId}/{TableId}?pageSize=1\n\nFilters items with a title equal to a defined value   \nExact title match   \n\n\nhttps://api.airtable.com/v0/{DatabaseId}/{TableId}?filterByFormula={title}=\"Ternes\"\n\nFilters records using a math function on one of their number field   \nWe want to display records with a currency field \"cost\" superior to defined amount   \n\n\nhttps://api.airtable.com/v0/{DatabaseId}/{TableId}?filterByFormula={cost}>1000000\nFilter a list by a related field\nA related field relates 2 tables. Let's take an example.\nA project table and an architect table. The \"architect\" field in the \"project\" table refer to the architect that have designed the project. An architect tables show more details on this architect.\nThe problem is that in the api the output of a related field is an array of the related records ids.\n\nSo I wandered if the query was something like\n\nBut it seems that is not the case, as the api always return this error mesage.\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"type\": \"INVALID_FILTER_BY_FORMULA\",\n    \"message\": \"The formula for filtering records is invalid: please check your formula text.\"\n  }\n}\n\nI've posted an issue on airtable.js client to know more about it. But after trial and error, tried with the name of the linked record (not it's id) and it worked !\n\nI am listing all projects of architects. I want to click on one architect name to have this list limited to only his projects. As we have just seen, I need his name to do the filtered projects request.\nBut now how to get the record name from the table query ? As I need it to make the query. Should I first hit a request to get all architect information, before making a request for his projects.\nThere seem to have a solution with the lookup fields \nLookup fields allow to list in the projects query a field of a related field table. As we need architect's name, we are going to choose architect table and name field. And that's it we have both the id and the name of the architect in our first project call.\n\nGreat !\nSo now the question is is there a way to query directly a list limited by one of it's related fields id? Which would be much more natural for a developer. Well I do no know yet :)\n"},"2017-09-07-offline.html":{"url":"2017-09-07-offline.html","title":"2017-09-07-offline","keywords":"","body":"2017-09-07-offline\n\nLearn offline A complete course with video and demo app to discover progressive web app and offline applications\nOffline cookbook\nprogressive web app with angular\nsw-precache webpack plugin\n\n"},"2017-07-20-angular-redux.html":{"url":"2017-07-20-angular-redux.html","title":"2017-07-20-angular-redux","keywords":"","body":"2017-07-20-angular-redux\n\nWhat it is?\nRedux is a way to store in a centralized place data so that all the app can udpate flowlessly by subscribing to some events.

Each feature module add a property to the store to make available the useful part of the global state\nreducer: main function where is defined the logic : (could be thought as the database tables). Pratically the reducer have the role to merge / save the state modification with the state global state. Another explanation :\n\nThe reducer is the thing that catches and handles the actions that are dispatched from your smart components (or from your action reducers), and it is also the thing that actually resets the state to a new, modified state.\n\n\n\nReducer could be thought as the database table in the store as a database analogy.\nReducer are a type of function in programmation, that work on a collection of object and produce a final unique object by running function at each loop turn. A very clear definition and examples are available in this ngrx tutorial.\n\nselector: function that in charge to retrieved view model structure that are data as need by the UI. \n\nSelector could be thought as the query in the store as a database analogy.\nLink to utility functions createSelector or createFeatureSelector\n\naction: an action triggered by the user like clicking on a button, changing view that impact the global state.

Only the listed routes support html5pushstate.\n * Has to match client side routes.\n *\n * Index (/) route does not have to be listed here.\n **/\nexport const routes: string[] = [\n  'app/fr',\n  'app/fr/home'\n  // list  more routes you want to be prerendered\n];\n\n\nserver.aot.ts : AOT version\nserver.ts : This file is the settings of the express server that render the page.\n\nOn thing that can be customised here is the directory of static assets\nHere we set images and css folder to be accessible from http://localhost:3000/images and http://localhost:3000/css\napp.use(\n  '/images',\n  cacheControl,\n  express.static(path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', '..', 'images'), {\n    maxAge: 30\n  })\n);\napp.use(\n  '/css',\n  cacheControl,\n  express.static(path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', '..', '..', 'build', 'css'), {\n    maxAge: 30\n  })\n);\n\nAs we have installed angular starter as a sub-directory in our project, we need to go back with the handy path.join syntax.\n.. Mean go back one folder\nFiles to handle CSR (Client Side Rendering)\nTo be configured or customized\n\nbrowser.module.ts Main angular @ngmodule for client side will replace your current MainModule or rootModule.\n\nTo keep as if of minimally customized\n\n__workaround.browser.ts : Patch of angular core (useful till angular v4) for CSR (Client Side Rendering) called by client.ts\nclient.aot.ts : bootstrap file version for AOT (Ahead of Time compilation)\nclient.ts : bootstrap file for non AOT settings.\n\nThe main features of bootstrap files is the replace the the standard bootstraper With a specific one. So this 3 lines are important :\nimport { platformUniversalDynamic } from 'angular2-universal/browser';\n\n// ...  More code\n\nexport const platformRef = platformUniversalDynamic();\n\nplatformRef.bootstrapModule(MainModule);\n\n// ...  More code\n\n\n__workaround.node.ts : Patch of angular core (useful till angular v4) for SSR (Server Side Rendering)\n\nIn this file is an example of a definition of a main @ngmodule that you should use or replicate if you want to be universal angular compatible.\nFiles used by both\n\nindex.html\n\nThe index.html is pretty standard and you can use yours but mind the line at the end. That insert the bundled file that is compiled by webpack. You should do the same\n\ntypings.d.ts An ambient type definition file that add typings to the variable used in this library. Look at the code to learn more about how to define types this way.\nangular2-meta.ts File code. Related to the way meta tags (the tags at the top of HEAD section of the html documented is handled)\n\nFiles in the src/app folder\nscr/+app folder on github\nThe files and sub-directories in this folder represent an example app with different cases you may encounter (lazy loading, loading data from an api..)\nThis is just an example app and you probably won't need it.\nAn exception could be a cache service\nIn universal-starter/src/+app/shared/\nYou may reuse some file to make the optional but recommended cache system functional in your app too.\npackage.json of the universal starter\nSpecific parts to be added for universal rendering\n{\n\n// Equivalent o platform browser but for the server\n\"@angular/platform-server\": \"~2.1.2\",\n\n// Deal with initialization\n\"@angularclass/bootloader\": \"~1.0.1\",\n\"@angularclass/idle-preload\": \"~1.0.4\",\n\n// Rendering engine for express that know angular 2\n\"angular2-express-engine\": \"~2.1.0-rc.1\",\n\"angular2-platform-node\": \"~2.1.0-rc.1\",\n\n// main library for angular 2 universal\n\"angular2-universal\": \"~2.1.0-rc.1\",\n\n// Some polyfill for the angular or node part\n\"angular2-universal-polyfills\": \"~2.1.0-rc.1\"\n}\n\nWebpack configuration\n\nwebpack.config.ts: The webpack config for development\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/universal-starter/blob/master/webpack.config.ts\nCommon configuration for client and server\n\ncommonConfig\n\nexport var clientConfig = {\n  target: 'web',\n  // We can change the entry point.\n  //It is the file that is first read by webpack\n  // following all its imports.\n  entry: './src/client',\n  // We can change the output path\n  output: {\n    path: root('dist/client')\n  },\n  node: {\n    global: true,\n    crypto: 'empty',\n    __dirname: true,\n    __filename: true,\n    process: true,\n    Buffer: false\n  }\n};\n\n\ncommonPlugins\n\nSpecific server configuration\n\nserverConfig\nserverPlugins\n\nSpecific client configuration\n\nclientConfig\nclientPlugins\nwebpack.prod.config.ts: The webpack config for prod\n\nhttps://github.com/angular/universal-starter/blob/master/webpack.prod.config.ts\nAngular universal debugging\n\nHow to know you have a problem ?\n\nThis error message should show \"Error in SSR, serving for direct CSR\" It means that the backend is just serving index.html and not being able to do any server side prerendering because of a problem.\n\nError: This method is not implemented in Parse5DomAdapter: getCookie\n\nThis error seem to be caused by http service. Angular universal is overriding http service, and depending of the position of the declaration of angular universal module in the @ngmodule it can be not the last version.\nSo look at the error stack, if you find something that is related to http call, try to comment the module, that do that first to check.\nAt least it is what is explained in this issue\nWhy http module is being overridden in universal module by MarkPieszak\n\nWell it depends on which Modules you're using, usually it can be first, but depending on if other Modules are overriding Http as well, sometimes you need to re-position it. I can't remember why Material is using Http, but in Universal we override it because we need to keep track of all requests, so we can determine when the App is stable, to then serialize it.\n\n\nReferenceError: document is not defined\n\nYou probably have imported UniversalModule several times in your code.\n\nOnly \"Error in SSR, serving for direct CSR\" with no more detail\n\nGo to your browser load the page, I should see an error in the console. I assume that it is the same error that occured in the backend.\nisBrowser or isNode\nThis two utility functions allow each part to know if they are browser side or server side.\nimport { isBrowser, isNode } from 'angular2-universal';\n\nexport class myComponent {\n\n  if (isBrowser()) {\n    // Only client side stuff\n    // document.\n    // window.\n  } else {\n    // simpler display but no error\n  }\n}\n\nPackage json scripts and explanation\n\"scripts\": {\n    \"watch\": \"webpack --watch\",\n    \"watch:dev\": \"npm run server & npm run watch\",\n    \"clean:dist\": \"rimraf dist\",\n    // clean ngc files (aoc compilation)\n    \"clean:ngc\": \"rimraf **/*.ngfactory.ts **/*.css.shim.ts\",\n    \"prebuild\": \"npm run clean:dist\",\n    // for normal build (not prod) we do  not use --config webpack.config.ts\n    // as webpack.config.ts is the default name webpack will search for\n    \"build\": \"webpack  --progress\",\n    \"build:prod:ngc\": \"npm run clean:ngc && npm run ngc && npm run clean:dist && npm run build:prod\",\n    \"build:prod:ngc:json\": \"npm run clean:ngc && npm run ngc && npm run clean:dist && npm run build:prod:json\",\n    \"build:prod\": \"webpack --config webpack.prod.config.ts\",\n    \"build:prod:json\": \"webpack --config webpack.prod.config.ts --json | webpack-bundle-size-analyzer\",\n    \"ngc\": \"ngc -p tsconfig.aot.json\",\n    \"prestart\": \"npm run build\",\n    // run the express server (by default on port 3000) using\n    // web pack bundled dist/server/index.js file\n    \"server\": \"nodemon dist/server/index.js\",\n    // Run the server in a way that it is inspectable (with breakpoint in chrome)\n    \"debug:server\": \"node --inspect --debug-brk dist/server/index.js\",\n    \"start\": \"npm run server\",\n    \"debug:start\": \"npm run build && npm run debug:server\",\n    \"predebug\": \"npm run build\",\n    \"debug:build\": \"node-nightly --inspect --debug-brk node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js\",\n    \"debug:build:prod\": \"node-nightly --inspect --debug-brk node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js  --config webpack.prod.config.ts\",\n    \"debug\": \"node --debug-brk dist/server/index.js\"\n  },\n\n"},"2017-01-05-angular-recipes.html":{"url":"2017-01-05-angular-recipes.html","title":"2017-01-05-angular-recipes","keywords":"","body":"2017-01-05-angular-recipes\nTips & tricks for tricky but useful things in angular 2. The type of problems that are too small to deserve a full blog post, and that you do not know how to name to search for.\nElvis operator and bracket notation\nBracket notation is javascript is an alternative to dot notation to display the content of an object. The main advantage is has is that you can use variable inside the bracket to display a property whose name depends of a variable.\nElvis operator is a syntax for angular 2 that allow to tell angular renderer to ignore template binding of sub-properties for object that does not exist yet. Indeed it is generally that the object is not yet loaded from the backend.\nFrom this link\nThe Elvis operator is only available for the . not for other dereference operators like []. As a workaround use\ndata?.record ? data.record['name/first'] : null\n\nSelect an element of the DOM\nWell explained here\nUse ViewChild with #localvariable as shown here,\n {{ todo.note }}\n\n\n\nIn component,\n//OLD Way\nimport {ElementRef} from '@angular/core';\n\n@ViewChild('someVar') el:ElementRef;\n\nngAfterViewInit()\n{\n   this.el.nativeElement.focus();\n\n}\n\nNew API with renderer....\n//NEW Way\nimport {ElementRef} from '@angular/core';\n\n    @ViewChild('someVar') el:ElementRef;\n\n\nconstructor(private rd: Renderer) {}\n\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\n    this.rd.invokeElementMethod(this.el.nativeElement,'focus');\n  }\n\nPrevent error when module are failing to be imported\nModule handling in JS is a headache. Sometimes it just don't works. But you still need to use a js lib the old way (with a script in the index.html).\nYou can fool typescript to allow you to use the missing library (that will exist at run time).\ndeclare var braintree:any;\n\nObject property binding & async pipe with bracket syntax\nYes but how to use a bracket syntax with async syntax.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/36803389/angular2-async-pipe-not-does-not-fill-object-data-into-template\nI have an observable that I want to pass to a component. Once passed I want a sub property that is static in that case : the first item of an array. Or may be dynamic, a component property.\nThe problem is that : (imagesFB | async)[0] would fail because the item does not exist at first and the async is for imagesFB not for the resulting array that (imagesFB | async) return.\nSo with a ternary syntax :\n (bolean) ? /* code if true */ : /* code if false */ ;`\n\nWe do the trick.\nui-gallery-image([image]=\"(imagesFB | async) ? (imagesFB | async)[0] : null\")\n\nInstanciation of class or static method\nThere is 3 keywords that can be used in a class. To defined a property or method\n\npublic to get the method available from other classes\nprivate to get it only usable inside the class\nstatic allow to use a class without instantiating it\nInstantiate a class, is creating a local copy of it. For example if we are in a component, that mean that we are using an instance of a class.\nAn instance is creating by passing it to the component constructor like this.\n\n\nimport { UploadService }         from '../../../services/api/upload.service'\n\nexport class UiUploadUploadcareComponent {\n  constructor(\n    private uploadService: UploadService,\n  ){\n  }\n\n  upload() {\n    // we use the instance of the class with this\n    this.uploadService.upload()\n  }\n\nBut by using static we do not need, and we cannot actually create a local instance\nimport { StaticService }         from '../../../services/static.service'\n\nexport class UiUploadUploadcareComponent {\n  constructor(\n    // we do not need to instanciate the class\n  ){\n  }\n\n  upload() {\n    // we use the static method useStaticClass\n    // of StaticService  class without the this keyword\n    StaticService.useStaticClass()\n  }\n\nSimplify module definition with the spread operator\n\nDoc of spread operator\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    ...MODULES\n  ],\n  declarations: [\n    ...PIPES,\n    ...COMPONENTS\n  ],\n  exports: [\n    ...MODULES,\n    ...PIPES,\n    ...COMPONENTS\n  ]\n})\n\nExport of modules to be compatible with lazy loading, AOT and universal angular\nconst PIPES = [\n  // put pipes here\n];\n\nconst COMPONENTS = [\n  // put shared components here\n];\n\nconst PROVIDERS = [\n  ModelService,\n  ApiService\n]\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    ...MODULES\n  ],\n  declarations: [\n    ...PIPES,\n    ...COMPONENTS\n  ],\n  exports: [\n    ...MODULES,\n    ...PIPES,\n    ...COMPONENTS\n  ]\n})\nexport class SharedModule {\n  static forRoot(): ModuleWithProviders {\n    return {\n      ngModule: SharedModule,\n      providers: [\n        ...PROVIDERS\n      ]\n    };\n  }\n}\n\nNavigate to a defined page in the component or service\nimport { ActivatedRoute, Router }           from '@angular/router';\n\n// Component definition\n\nconstructor(\n    private router: Router,\n    private route: ActivatedRoute,\n  ) {}\n\n// Inside a component method\n\nthis.router.navigate([], { queryParams: {step : this.order.step}, relativeTo: this.route });\n\nDo somethings after 2 or more promises resolve\nUsage of Rxjs Observable.combineLatest to do something and combine the results of the 2 or more promises resolved.\nimport { Observable } from 'rxjs'\n\nObservable.combineLatest(\n      this.translationService.getTranslation(\"reset_title\"),\n      this.translationService.getTranslation(\"reset_desc\")\n    )\n    .subscribe(results => {\n      // DO something\n    })\n\nRedirect to the same path but changing one query params\nThe trick is [] to tell same page.\nthis.router.navigate([], { relativeTo: this.route, queryParams: { step: this.steps[0] } });\n\nRedirect to the same path changing only the last path parameter\nThe trick is to use relative path syntax of angular 2 router\n// change orderId only while we are at order/22 for example\n// but keeping all parameters\nthis.router.navigate(['../', this.order._id], { queryParams: this.params, relativeTo: this.route });\n\n// For this  path (defined in routing configuration)\n{ path: 'order/:orderId', component: SROrderPage },\n\nwatching queryparams and params changes\n\nqueryparams  are optional ?step=2&lang=fr so step and lang\nparams are in the path /project/:projectId so project Id in that cas\n\nFor both we use the Activated route service, so we place in our constructor\nconstructor(\n    private route: ActivatedRoute) {}\n\nthen we set a watcher in our ngInit()\nngOnInit() {\n      this.route\n      .params\n      .subscribe(routeParams => {\n        // trigger when route params change\n        // routeParams = { projectId: 22 }\n      });\n\n      this.route\n      .queryParams\n      .subscribe(queryParams => {\n        // trigger when route params change\n        // project/22?lang=fr\n        // queryParams = { lang: 'fr '}\n      });\n\n  }\n\nFor query params read this good tuto for more info\nExecute a js library outside of the scope of angular\nAngular run inside an execution context so is not accesible in the global scope of the page. But some libraries like jquery exist in the global scope of the page.\nSo here is an example on how to run a jquery library from an angular component.\nImport of the NgZone module\nimport {\n    Component, Input, Output, EventEmitter, NgZone, forwardRef, AfterViewInit,\n    OnDestroy, Directive, ElementRef, Host\n} from '@angular/core';\n\nDefinition in the component constructor\nconstructor(private el: ElementRef, private zone: NgZone) {\n\nUse of this.zone.runOutsideAngular(() => {\nto switch execution zone\n   /**\n     * init slick\n     */\n    initSlick() {\n        const self = this;\n\n        this.zone.runOutsideAngular(() => {\n            this.$instance = $(this.el.nativeElement).slick(this.config);\n            this.initialized = true;\n\n            this.$instance.on('afterChange', (event, slick, currentSlide) => {\n                self.zone.run(() => {\n                    self.afterChange.emit({event, slick, currentSlide});\n                });\n            });\n\n            this.$instance.on('beforeChange', (event, slick, currentSlide, nextSlide) => {\n                self.zone.run(() => {\n                    self.beforeChange.emit({event, slick, currentSlide, nextSlide});\n                });\n            });\n\n            this.$instance.on('breakpoint', (event, slick, breakpoint) => {\n                self.zone.run(() => {\n                    self.breakpoint.emit({event, slick, breakpoint});\n                });\n            });\n\n            this.$instance.on('destroy', (event, slick) => {\n                self.zone.run(() => {\n                    self.destroy.emit({event, slick});\n                });\n            });\n        });\n    }\n\nAdd even, odd and last class to ngFor\ndiv(\n    *ngFor=\"let item of item; let last = last; let odd = odd; let even = even; let index = index;\",\n    [ngClass]=\"{'odd': odd,'even': even,'last': last}\", \n    class=\"item item-{{ index }}\")\n\nwill result in\n\nFirst item\n\n\nSecond item\n\n\nThird item\n\n\nDynamic templates\nIn angular 2 your can use dynamic templates called by name Primeng library make heavy use of it, you can see as an illustration templates definitions here\nInjection parent component in child component\nExample and explanations in the slick-carousel integration tutorial\n\n@ContentChildren() allow  to have a reference to a child component in the parent component \n@Host() allow  to have a reference to a parent component in the child component \n\n@Directive({\n  selector: '[slick-carousel-item]',\n})\nexport class SlickCarouselItem {\n  constructor(private el: ElementRef, @Host() private carousel: SlickCarouselComponent) {\n  }\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\n    this.carousel.addSlide(this);\n  }\n  ngOnDestroy() {\n    this.carousel.removeSlide(this);\n  }\n}\n\nHttp interceptor\nHttp intercetptor intercept http requests for example to add a token to all API request.\nDefine interceptor service in the app.module.ts\nExample of intecptor file\nExecute a function with a delay in an angular component\nUse environnement variable in your component or service\nhttps://medium.com/beautiful-angular/angular-2-and-environment-variables-59c57ba643be\nAsync handling automation and Progressive Web app\nhttps://medium.com/@cyrilletuzi/angular-async-pipe-everywhere-with-ngx-pwa-offline-d8de68845c81\nSharing data / method between component\nhttps://angularfirebase.com/lessons/sharing-data-between-angular-components-four-methods/\nSetup of universal server side rendering (updated)\nhttps://angularfirebase.com/lessons/server-side-rendering-firebase-angular-universal/\n"},"2017-10-20-angular-development-roadmap.html":{"url":"2017-10-20-angular-development-roadmap.html","title":"2017-10-20-angular-development-roadmap","keywords":"","body":"2017-10-20-angular-development-roadmap\n\n2017-10 : The new features in angular 5\n\n"},"2017-05-31-observables-rxjs-recipes.html":{"url":"2017-05-31-observables-rxjs-recipes.html","title":"2017-05-31-observables-rxjs-recipes","keywords":"","body":"2017-05-31-observables-rxjs-recipes\nWhere to find information to lean RXJS for Angular\n\nA more cleanly designed doc that the original\nrxjs / The original doc\nA selection of 6 operators to know\nAnother Online book on RXJS\nA playground to display obersable in action\n\nUnsubscribing to observable in Angular\n\nhttps://blog.codecentric.de/en/2018/01/different-ways-unsubscribing-rxjs-observables-angular/\nhttps://medium.com/@benlesh/rxjs-dont-unsubscribe-6753ed4fda87\n\nCreate a timer with observable\nCreate a timer that will emit a value every 5000ms.\nconst timer = Rx.Observable.interval(5000);\n\njs bin example of 2 sources (2 intervals emitters) with the second slower\n[Observable] Observable.combineLatest\n\nWhen to use? : You have 2 queries or more.

It seems really complicated with various system, a terminology that at first we do not understand.\n\nLet's list a few facts, we have understood.\nEnabling the API's and discovering API manager\n\nAccessing  the api guide https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/accessing-the-api\n\nthe tutorial suggest you\n\nEnable both the Google App Engine Admin API and Google Cloud Storage API in your Cloud Platform project:\n\nSo :\n\nApi's are not enabled by default\nthere is 2 concepts :\ngoogle cloud storage : for storing static files\ngoogle app engine : to compute app like a virtual machine\n\n\n\nWhen clicking on the enable all apis button\nI notice a panel that is about APIS\n\nThat go to a page dedicated to all APIs. Not only the 2 mentioned, but more APIS that are in those 2 groups of APIS- storage and compute.\n\nThis page is also accessible via a side menu.\n\nOnce in the APIs Manager page, you have a credentials menu item.\n\nThe last item of this menu offer to help choose. Good idea!\nYou can access this wizard directly at this link.\nWhat type of authentication?\nThere is 3 types :\n\nAPI keys : A simple  API key. Some were already generated by the browser or the server (per aps by firebase) in my case.\nOAuth 2.0 client IDs : A way to create an account on you site thanks to their google login (for your app users)\nService account keys : A variant or API keys?\n\nWhat is Application Default Credentials?\nFor the case of a server that want to have access to the app. I ended with the concept of Application Default Credentials. Documented in this page.\nI am interested in the node.js version\nIt use a library :https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client which is global to all google APIs.\n\nGoogle's officially supported Node.js client library for accessing Google APIs. Support for authorization and authentication with OAuth 2.0, API Keys and JWT (Service Tokens) is included\n\nSo let's install it :\nnpm install googleapis --save\nAnother place to look at is this page\nhttps://developers.google.com/identity/\nWhich is the identification temple of google! All google methods to authenticate.\nAmong which this mysterious Application Default Credentials.\nAfter reading a bit, it seems there is another node.js more specific library only for google authentication.\nLet's use it, as its doc should be clearer (as it is more specific)\n\nThis is Google's officially supported node.js client library for using OAuth 2.0 authorization and authentication with Google APIs.\n\nhttps://github.com/google/google-auth-library-nodejs\nSo again :\nnpm install google-auth-library --save\nThe google-cloud-node library the library to use\nWhile reading a discussion on how to use google storage instead of firebase (which does not have a SDK yet in node.js) https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-node\nSo let's sum up :\n\nhttps://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client Manage all google apis with node.js app independently of gcloud\nhttps://github.com/google/google-auth-library-nodejs Manage only the authentication in the  context of gcloud or not\nhttps://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-node the gcloud specific library\n\nThe response of Aurelien is quite interesting\nYes I found the source!\nGoogle cloud\n\ngoogle-cloud is a client library for accessing Google Cloud Platform services that significantly reduces the boilerplate code you have to write.\n\nYes, I do not like writing boiler plate code! After hours of search I am quite happy to see this promise of simplicity.\n https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-node/#/\nAnd google cloud is the recommended way, good to know....\n\nThe Google APIs Node.js Client is a client library for using the broad set of Google APIs. google-cloud is built specifically for the Google Cloud Platform and is the recommended way to integrate Google Cloud APIs into your Node.js applications. If your application requires both Google Cloud Platform and other Google APIs, the 2 libraries may be used by your application.\n\ngoogle-cloud-node do not take my json  key\nHere is a much more detailed description on how to authenticate with google-cloud SDK (not be mistaken with gcloud the command line utility) https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-node/#/docs/google-cloud/0.45.0/guides/authentication\nThen I set my authentication in my node.js file.\nvar gcloud = require('gcloud')({\n  // the project Id is the unique id of the project\n  // derived from the project name\n  // it looks like myproject-1d298\n  projectId: 'myProject-Name',\n  keyFileName: './bamarchi-42fde040ae9d.json',\n});\n\nThe keyfileName is the path to the service account key you have created in the google cloud console at https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials\n\nAnd relaunched my API using those settings. But was stopped by an other error.\nfirebase there was an error uploading to gcloud Error: Could not load the default credentials. Browse to https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/application-default-credent\n\nI then investigated the code that triggered this error, and found that the code is checking if the code is executed from a google cloud Engine (GCE) or not.\nSo if it is not the case (I am in local), it triggered this error independently of if it found the famous service key or not.\nBy reading again this the page linked in the error https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials\nApplication Default credential need to be set in an env variable!\nI figured that to set the application default credentials, we need to modify an environment variable.What is a environment variable?They are UNIX variables that you can set in the command line by typing export.\nexport nameOftheVariable=\"valueOfTheVariable\"\n\nTo get a list of variable already defined in your machine.\nJust type :\nexport\n\nYou will be surprised to find :\n\nPATH The list of directory where are placed some executables\nPWD the current directory\n....\n\nand lot of basic settings very important everywhere :)\nSo let's set application default credentials as mentioned in the doc :\nexport GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=\"/path/to/the/myproject-key.json\"\n\nCredentials fixed / What's next ?\nThe last export command seemed to have solved the credential missing error. I understood also that only the environmental is necessary, or at least only that is successful to authenticate. But my google cloud quest is not finished!\nHere is the next error message. What is not found ?\n\nThe api route used by gcloud bucket.upload function?\nOr the file I am giving it to upload?\nOr the bucket?\n\nBy the way what is the file format it is expecting?

This page is the documentation on Gcloud storage upload module.\nThere are 3 types of upload :\n\nsimple : only a file\nmulti-part : a file + its metadata\nresumable : that can resume if a network disconnection occurred (for large file)\n\nBy going in the official doc, it was quite abstract and confusing. But reading at the code @example was more instructive\n\nSimple upload with link to a local file\n\n@example\n* //-\n* // The easiest way to upload a file.\n* //-\n* bucket.upload('/local/path/image.png', function(err, file, apiResponse) {\n*   // Your bucket now contains:\n*   // - \"image.png\" (with the contents of `/local/path/image.png')\n*\n*   // `file` is an instance of a File object that refers to your new file.\n* });\n*\n\n\nWith some options\n\nResumable options is interesting as it allow to resume the upload if the network connection is lost.\nAlso the metadata object seem a non standardized object where you choose which metadata to add, great for simple image annotation....\n* //-\n* // It's not always that easy. You will likely want to specify the filename\n* // used when your new file lands in your bucket.\n* //\n* // You may also want to set metadata or customize other options.\n* //-\n* var options = {\n*   destination: 'new-image.png',\n*   resumable: true,\n*   validation: 'crc32c',\n*   metadata: {\n*     event: 'Fall trip to the zoo'\n*   }\n* };\n*\n* bucket.upload('local-image.png', options, function(err, file) {\n*   // Your bucket now contains:\n*   // - \"new-image.png\" (with the contents of `local-image.png')\n*\n*   // `file` is an instance of a File object that refers to your new file.\n* });\n*\n\n\nGzip on the fly!\n\n* //-\n* // You can also have a file gzip'd on the fly.\n* //-\n* bucket.upload('index.html', { gzip: true }, function(err, file) {\n*   // Your bucket now contains:\n*   // - \"index.html\" (automatically compressed with gzip)\n*\n*   // Downloading the file with `file.download` will automatically decode the\n*   // file.\n* });\n*\n\n\nOverwrite an existing file\n\n* //-\n* // You may also re-use a File object, {module:storage/file}, that references\n* // the file you wish to create or overwrite.\n* //-\n* var options = {\n*   destination: bucket.file('existing-file.png'),\n*   resumable: false\n* };\n*\n* bucket.upload('local-img.png', options, function(err, newFile) {\n*   // Your bucket now contains:\n*   // - \"existing-file.png\" (with the contents of `local-img.png')\n*\n*   // Note:\n*   // The `newFile` parameter is equal to `file`.\n* });\n*\n\n\nEncrypt the files\n\n* //-\n* // To use\n* // \n* // Customer-supplied Encryption Keys, provide the `encryptionKey` option.\n* //-\n* var crypto = require('crypto');\n* var encryptionKey = crypto.randomBytes(32);\n*\n* bucket.upload('img.png', {\n*   encryptionKey: encryptionKey\n* }, function(err, newFile) {\n*   // `img.png` was uploaded with your custom encryption key.\n*\n*   // `newFile` is already configured to use the encryption key when making\n*   // operations on the remote object.\n*\n*   // However, to use your encryption key later, you must create a `File`\n*   // instance with the `key` supplied:\n*   var file = bucket.file('img.png', {\n*     encryptionKey: encryptionKey\n*   });\n*\n*   // Or with `file#setEncryptionKey`:\n*   var file = bucket.file('img.png');\n*   file.setEncryptionKey(encryptionKey);\n* });\n*\n* //-\n* // If the callback is omitted, we'll return a Promise.\n* //-\n* bucket.upload('local-image.png').then(function(data) {\n*   var file = data[0];\n* });\n*/\n\nFile get found? Use of fs module\nBut back to our concerns, why this error, 404, not found. I was suspecting that it was the file that was not found.\nSo I had the idea to use fs module to check first if the file exist. To prevent stupid file not found error.\nI realized 2 things:\n\nfiles are relative to the file where we are (not the starter file of the node process)\nWe can use __dirname to get the absolute directory where we are and path.join\nAs this stack overflow response suggest.\n\n\nSo we wrap our bucket.upload call in a fs.exists function to be sure the file exist before trying to upload it to google storage.\nvar filePath = path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', '..', 'files', 'upload', filemeta.newName);\n    fs.exists(filePath, function(exists) {\n      if (exists) {\n        debug('going to upload the file' + filePath);\n        bucket.upload(filePath, function(err, file) {\n        ...\n\nThe bucket Id!\nBy looking at the cloud storage console, I realized that some request was logged.6 requests, so the API was hit.A first step.\n\nBut my there was an error uploading to gcloud { ApiError: Not Found remain.\nAnd looking at more detail. It is 6 client errors (4XX errors).\n\nBy searching this error message in google I found the error message page and their description (for the specific google-cloud-storage API). https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/status-codes Not very informative but the phrase is\n\nThe following is an example of an error response you receive if you try to retrieve an object that does not exist.\n\nSo I searched an object, I suspect an object in cloud storage so either a file object or a bucket object.... But as I was uploading a new file and not updating it. I suppose it could be the bucket?\nI went to google storage configuration page. There is one page to manage API's all API's. And one page per service / module. When you do not use the module yet, you have a card linking to documentation...\nAnd found the id of my bucket different from the id of the project. I had put the projectId instead.\nThat was it!\n\nThe quest is over / First upload to google storage\nAfter 1-2 days on it. I understood :\n\nsome facts about node.js : fs and path module\nMade my way through google cloud online console\nChoose a library in node.js to communicate with it\nFixed temporarily the authentication problem\n\nBecause the remaining problems are :\n\nHow to to authenticate in the project and not with the not very handy environmental variable\n\nBut now I am no more stuck and get back to work.

But its documentation is definitely not good. Let's list and explain shorty the difference between each useful functions this library provide.\nBlue bird documentation\nPromise Concepts\n\nSequential or Parallel processing\n\nSequential processing means each promises is processed one after the other. Could be useful if you want to have a control on the flow of processing. Or if you need the result of previous promise to process the next.\nParallel processing means the promises are processed at the same time.

Calling the function is something entirely different, as defining a function does not execute its code.\nWe need to call the function in order for something to happen, and that is also the case with an Observable: we need to subscribe to it in order for it to work!\n\nhttp://blog.angular-university.io/angular-2-rxjs-common-pitfalls/\n\nBuilding a data store with observable http://blog.angular-university.io/how-to-build-angular2-apps-using-rxjs-observable-data-services-pitfalls-to-avoid/\nThe Doc of observables transform operator http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html#transforming\n\nngFor, ngIf, ...\n\nRevision of what ngFor can do\n\nhow to get the index\nhow to track by another value that default (by object Identity)\nusing odd, even, last, first for dynamic class naming\n\n\nngFor by default tracks list items using object identity.

The rise of ES6 is parallel to the release of angular 2. Angular choose to have dependencies on typescript though it is possible to use angular 2 without typescript\nTypescript\nTypescript is a superset of ES6. It means it has all features of ES6 plus additional features. The main differentiating feature is typings hence the name typescript https://www.typescriptlang.org But not only, it allows also to use the decorator syntax @ used by angular heavily.\nAt first I was not very enthusiastic to use Typescript, first because it is a software initiated by Microsoft and I kept with some bad opinions about this firm. But also because I kept with the idea typings was a thing for old fashioned java, c++ guys and was not useful in modern workflows.\nI changed my mind, about Microsoft and about hard typings!\nIt could be really useful, and the best is that you can use it a lot or in a minimal way if you want. It allow you to intercept simple errors before compilation, which is not bad.\nThe drawbacks are :\n\nyou can have bugs only caused by typings stuff....\nyou need to compile back to a file readable by the browser but less readable by you. But anyway with ES6 we will be obliged to work like this, till ES6 will be readable directly in all browsers.\n\nSystem.js and ES6 stuff\nThe ES6 modules\nES6 typescript introduce the javascript modules syntax import { myModule} from '../../file.js';\nIt is nice because it allow to define what each files need in a declarative style. The previous way to do that, was simply to add many scripts files in a html fil. Or concatenate a bunch of files in one files. But no explicit relations was set between those files.\nWith the modules, every file \"require\" / \"import\" the files it need to execute properly. If you practice Node.js you should be familiar with that and the really simple idea it is.\nYou need a package loader!\nES6 is not only syntax changes\nComponents everywhere\nComponents angular clear syntax\nThe component syntax is much, much clearer that in angular 1. By the way everything is component. That mean that no part of the page rendered by angular is not a component. That does not mean you need to over structure your app, with components, sub-components. It is up to you to be granular as it is useful for you\nCss scoping / Web component like pseudo phantom DOM\nAngular 2 introduce an elegant way to use component specific / phantom dom, without waiting for full browser support. Let's reacall what it is. Phantom DOM is a way to isolate the DOM of a component from the interior world so that global CSS do not impact it.\nLet's take a simple example. You have a sidebar component, with it's style that you want everyone on the planet to be able to use, and also be sure that it's graphical appearance will be preserved.\nWithout phantom DOM, it is feasible, but you cannot garanty that the appearance of your component will be always preserved. Indeed the only way to style it in a secure way is to use a sort of name spacing with your component css.\n. complicated-and-specic-name_body {   \n   background: blue; \n}\n\nBut there is always a way to override in the site where it is used. Only with iframe we can achieve this independance of component.\nWith phantom DOM, we can as the DOM inside the component, in a similar way than the iframe DOM, is not accessible and targetable by css rules from the exterior.\nThe problem is the phantom DOM implementation is not yet ready. So in angular 2 they found a system to by pass this (with attributes component name space) and be able ot switch to full phantom DOM support when ready.\nWith this improvement the 3 part of a web components - css, html and js - are packagable in a convenient way. Component by component and without needing to include a full library where 80% of elements are not useful for you.\nBinding\n\nthe syntax has changed\nthe 2 way bindings is no more the default\nTop > bottom binding is the default : the binding propagate to component and sub-components\nTo make bottom > top updates, you need to use a event system \n\nObservable on top of promise\nObservable are a new type of async object, like promise but with much more possibilities. The doc of observables is available here : reactivex.io.\nPractically at first it could be as simple as replacing the then of promises by the subscribe of observable. But as you get more familiar with observables, you can do more.\nDebugging\nThe debug tools are not the same. I've not finished to discovered the possibilities. But I've found a chrome extension Augury that seem the defacto standard for viewing components hierarchy and properties. It display very nicely the dependencies, the components nesting.\nThough it does not always display all the public properties of the components classes. It is possible to type $a to debug in the console the component available properties. Though I did not find yet the equivalent of $scope.mydata in angular 1 : a quick way to output available data directly from the element tab of chrome debugger;\nIt seems that is is not more necessary to write $log.debug as the standard console.log seems enough. How to prevent console logs to display in prod?
