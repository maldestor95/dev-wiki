# SaaS images services

Images as a service is a convenient to handle images upload in a web site.

## Why an image as service \(IaaS\)

Here are some features, those types of services are doing.

* Image uploader \(Optional\)
* Backup
* Image resize thanks to an url with special transformations parameters
* REST API to manage the stored images
* CDN to serve image faster

  ...

It allow you to spare the time :

* to develop similar functionnality.
* to manage only you software code and not the site assets which generally are the heaviest ressources and require specific handling

## Comparison of the services

Here is a comparison table of the different services. It is not easy as the different services use different metrics to price their offers.

Feel free to suggest me other I have not listed here. I included only the first plan below 100$.

## Free alternatives

Here are also some free alternatives :

* A service that allow you to use the image where they are only for transformation. So you do not need an api or a user account [https://rsz.io](https://rsz.io)
* Also, image manipulation and resizing is not that hard so you can also use some nice libraries
